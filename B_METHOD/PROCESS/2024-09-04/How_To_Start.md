# S.O.S. How should I start? And where?

- Ascending, identifying themes, recurring themes... or not! Then they can be linked to others, hierarchically, cause and effect.
  Represent this graphically (large mind map), markdown or on keyword paper.
  Draw things from them, e.g. psychology, sociology, etc., which will lead to the creation of the plan.
- All these keywords can also be found in my materials. I can represent my key words in one way and those I've learned in another, which would enable me to dive straight into the subject. The 4 main themes can be used to draw the main headings of my dissertation.
- A conclusion doesn't appear directly. But it sure going to answer part of the problematic at the beginning.

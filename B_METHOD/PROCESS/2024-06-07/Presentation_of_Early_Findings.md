The word "through" calls out to be rephrased. Perhaps the axes should not be revealed.
The role of skeuomorphism for both designers and users.
Methodology, the themes that will structure the structure.
Generally speaking, it works well. But we need to refine it. What exactly do I do? How do I organize the interviews, what method, what interface, to understand the use of skeuomorphism.
Computer, mobile, and others!

Now the most important thing is to get the methodological aspect right. What do I get people to do?
Find variability, people who have experienced skeuomorphism or not.
For the practical project, make a grid of sub-themes, which could be interesting.

Roles proposed by designers, and roles proposed by users.
Theoretical framework: the notion of affordance. How an interface can make the user understand how it works; door handle, microphone, etc. (William W. Gaver)

# Small Presentation Output with Nicolas Nova, Daniel Schiboz and Joël Vacheron

## Feedback
The subject has a big visual dimension to it, so there should be a lot of visual analysis and graphic design.
It's also about perception, time situating of these interfaces.
GUIs also have the "power" to create quick nostalgia, like when people see UIs from three years ago and they can feel nostalgia.

For the big themes, I need to find a way to problematise them. I can find cases and describe them (describe each part of interfaces) just like how I did for the interviews. With the goal of driving me to a conclusion.

The research question can now be "what is the evolution of interface through ..." Questioning evolution.

Joël also mentioned FOMO (fear of missing out).

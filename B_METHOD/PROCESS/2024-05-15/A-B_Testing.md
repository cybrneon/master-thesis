# A/B Testing

### Overview
I need to make an experiment with two people as a startup point for my research.

### The Setup
- Computers positioned in front of the subjects:
  - 1 running an old version of [macOS](../../DICTIONARY/macOS.md) (Mac OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion, considered peak Skeuomorphism).
  - 1 running a "recent" version of [Windows](../../DICTIONARY/Windows.md) (10, 1507).

### Process
1. Sit in front of the computer.
2. *"This is a computer. Make it yours, use the inbox apps, all while describing everything you do and feel for the next 10 minutes."*
3. If the user is lost, give them ideas like:
   - Change the wallpaper in Settings.
   - Write some notes in the notes app
   - Add a contact name for someone you just met.
   - Put an event in the Calendar.
   - Open an image in the drive.
   - Write an email to a friend.
   - Play some music.
4. After 10 minutes, end the experience and get their insights about the overall experience:
   - Was the user interface easy to navigate?
   - Did you enjoy using apps?
   - _Skeuomorphism makes interface objects in a UI design familiar to users by using concepts they recognize_. Would you like Skeuomorphism to come back?

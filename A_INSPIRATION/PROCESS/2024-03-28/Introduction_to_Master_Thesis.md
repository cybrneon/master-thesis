# Introduction to the Master Thesis
### With Nicolas Nova

## Intro of an intro
After the discussing my ideas for a master thesis at the end of the HEAD x Ecal Research Week with Anthony Masure, I came to the conclusion that I would like to work on user interfaces in the field of open-source software.

I knew for months that I wanted to work on user interfaces/graphical user interfaces.

Here were ideas I've been writing since October 23:
- Why open source UI design is boring? looks bad?
- User Interfaces in the age of spatial computing.
- Web browsers UI? Experimental UI?
- The democratisation of personal computers and smartphones through UI. (ex. Skeumorphism)
- Keynote and presentation apps UI (Keynote, PPT, Slides)
- Sexyness of user interfaces in the indie app developer scene.

Anthony told me that the first idea sounds more interesting and funny. The open source software dilema is interesting.
But skeuomorphism can also be interesting. I need to find a way to make it interesting.

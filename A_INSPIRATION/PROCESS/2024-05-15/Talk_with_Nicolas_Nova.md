# Talk with Nicolas Nova

### 💬 Conversation
We talked about how lots of professionals voice their ideas and critiques of [Skeuomorphism](../../../B_METHOD/DICTIONARY/Skeuomorphism.md), but what could be interesting is talking and researching the people who actually use these interfaces day to day. This could define the links to Nostalgia, Materiality and Accessibility.

### ⏩ What's next?
I need to define the [A/B Testing process](../../../B_METHOD/PROCESS/2024-05-15/A-B_Testing.md) that I can try on people before the 30th of May.

## 🧪 Final Research Question Rethinking

- What is the Role of Skeuomorphism through Materiality, Accessibility and Nostalgia?

# Design Research Questions
## 📒 Themes/Topics
Here are themes/topics I find interesting:

- **Open Source**
Open source is source code that is made freely available for possible modification and redistribution. Products include permission to use the source code, design documents, or content of the product. The open-source model is a decentralised software development model that encourages open collaboration.

- **UI Design**
User interface (UI) design or user interface engineering is the design of user interfaces for machines and software, such as computers, home appliances, mobile devices, and other electronic devices, with the focus on maximising usability and the user experience.

- **Skeuomorphism**
Skeuomorphism is a term most often used in graphical user interface design to describe interface objects that mimic their real-world counterparts in how they appear and/or how the user can interact with them. A well-known example is the recycle bin icon used for discarding files.

- **Flat Design**
Flat design is a style of interface design emphasizing minimalist use of simple elements, typography, and flat colors. Designers may prefer flat design because it allows interface designs to be more streamlined and efficient.

- **Interaction Design**
Interaction design, often abbreviated as IxD, is "the practice of designing interactive digital products, environments, systems, and services,   While interaction design has an interest in form (similar to other design fields), its main area of focus rests on behavior.

- **Experience Design**
**User experience design** (**UX design**, **UXD**, **UED**, or **XD**) defines the experience a user would go through when interacting with a company, its services, and its products. User Experience Design is a user centered design approach because it considers the user's experience when using a product or platform.

- **Design System**
A design system is a collection of reusable components and clear standards that can be assembled together to build any number of applications. Design systems aid in digital product design and development of products such as mobile applications or websites. They may contain but are not limited to, pattern/component libraries, design languages, style guides (font, color, spacing, placement), coded components, brand languages, and documentation.

- **Free Software (as in Libre software, libreware)**
Free software is computer software distributed under terms that allow users to run the software for any purpose as well as to study, change, and distribute it and any adapted versions. Free software is a matter of liberty, not price; all users are legally free to do what they want with their copies of a free software (including profiting from them) regardless of how much is paid to obtain the program. Computer programs are deemed "free" if they give end-users (not just the developer) ultimate control over the software and, subsequently, over their devices.

- **Frutiger Aero**
Frutiger Aero (also known as Web 2.0 Gloss) is a broad design style and aesthetic that was prevalent in advertising, media, stock imagery and technology from roughly 2004 to 2014, following the end of the Y2K era. Overlapping with the McBling and ElectroPop 08 aesthetics, it is characterised by its vast use of Skeuomorphism, glossy textures, cloudy skies, tropical fish, water, bubbles, glass, lens flare, sprawling patterns, "humanism", aero glass, bokeh, Frutiger fonts, Abstract Tech, auroras and bright, vibrant colors (usually greens and blues).

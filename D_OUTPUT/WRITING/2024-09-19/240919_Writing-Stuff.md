### 1. Retromedia-in-practice

While interviewing people for my research, I remember seeing their faces light up each time I got a device out of my super heavy travel bag. "Wow! Do all of them work?" - The answer was always a "Yes!" And they were excited to dive into the world of old technology.

### 2. Physicality

With the whole goal of Skeuomorphism in UI Design, computers really felt like machines made out of real world materials: "I feel like today, we have these computers and smartphone with flat and boring interfaces that show abstract icons and graphics compared to old technology. It feels like they pre-chewed the work."

When you used your computer, listening to music using Windows Media Player or iTunes really felt like you were going to use a physical mp3 player or a Hi-Fi system. And that made the experience a whole lot more interesting, interacting with life like objects, through a screen. It also made the concept of music listening on the computer more mechanical.

### 3. Accessibility
With Skeuomorphism, came easier understandings of user interface elements. Appearing at the same time computers started flooding homes, it helped introduce computing to multiple different generations. This is when the most iconic symbol was introduced, the trash bin.

The entire goal of Skeuomorphism was to guide people into a new 

### 4. Metaphors
Metaphors.


# Emotions and Feelings

### 1. Nostalgia
What is nostalgia? How does nostalgia come into effect in user interfaces.

### 2. Dreams of a Better World
A better world, bringing technology and computing closer to nature, plants and water.


# Visual and Auditive Style

### 1. The Skeuomorphic Design Principles
What makes a user interface skeuomorphic. Analog Objects as Digital Objects. 3D shapes and elements. Gradients and Shadows; playing with light and dimensions.

### 2. The Skeuomorphic Spectrum
Listing, differentiating and analysing a big chunk of "Skeuomorphic" User Interfaces.

### 3. Audio
How Audio also helps with the immersion and adaptability of the interface. iPhone lock sound, trash bin, notification whoosh, ...

### 4. Motion
How Motion is used to replicate real life objects. Page turning, 3d movement in space, ...


# Legacy

### 1. Frutiger Aero
Frutiger Aero, also called Web 2.0 Gloss, is a retrospective name applied to a design trend in user interfaces and design aesthetics from the early internet days till the 2010s.

In the recent months, a revival was felt.

### 2. The Future of User Interfaces
What's coming next?? Taking some skeuomorphic design interfaces. How people are fed up with Flat Design in the recent months. Skeuomorphism in spatial computing (AR/VR).

### 3. AI?
AI is getting into the designer's design process. How? Why? Is it working?


# Conclusion
Finish.

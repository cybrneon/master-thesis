- If modern user interfaces put usability at the forefront with clean, bright UI and no unnecessary features, why do smartphones and computers feel so complex today?
- Windows Phone's Metro UI metaphors in a skeumorphic world. (floppy disk icon for save, trash bin, pen, etc. compared to iOS's later redesign with labels only for save, delete, edit, etc.)
- Skeuomorphism makes things and actions tangible.
- "When emotion enters design, it is not an end in itself but a mode of persuasive communication that serves a broader argument. The problem for design is to put an audience of users into a frame of mind so that when they use a product they are persuaded that it is emotionally desirable and valuable to their lives." (Buchanan, 1985, p. 16)
- Skeuomorphism in Apple's iOS:
	- Ethos: Create trust and familiarity with UIs
	- Pathos: Create a deeper connection between iOS and its user, feelings of accomplishment and positiveness
	- Logos: Show that devices are easy to use.
- We tend to forget that skeuomorphism is still present today, in sound for example (Camera App's shutter sound)
- We may think that skeuomorphism disappeared but I think that's thinking with a narrow westerner mind. I think that countries in Asia like Japan still use skeuomorphism in websites and user interfaces. That would be interesting to discuss, think of all the cultural differences that influence user interface design.
- “When we sat down last November (to work on iOS 7), we understood that people had already become comfortable with touching glass, they didn’t need physical buttons, they understood the benefits,” says Ive. “So there was an incredible liberty in not having to reference the physical world so literally. We were trying to create an environment that was less specific. It got design out of the way.”
  “This is the first post-Retina (Display) UI (user interface), with amazing graphics processing thanks to tremendous GPU (graphics processing unit) power growth, so we had a different set of tools to bring to bear on the problem as compared to seven years ago (when the iPhone first launched). Before, the shadowing effect we used was a great way to distract from the limitations of the display. But with a display that’s this precise, there’s nowhere to hide. So we wanted a clear typography.”
  Jony Ive, September 2013
- A race to dematerialisation, also through interfaces? Is this why people want to bring back skeuomorphism and all that style?
- We witnessed the voyage from skeuomorphic, realistic and 3D UI, to complete flat UIs, because that was the trend, and now we're kind of backtracking? We're witnessing a rebirth of skeuomorphism in a new way, shape and form.
  WHY? HOW IS IT COMING BACK? (They call that Flat 2.0, Google called it Material Design in 2014 *-Now at version 3-*, Microsoft called it Fluent Design in 2017 *-Now at version 2-*).
